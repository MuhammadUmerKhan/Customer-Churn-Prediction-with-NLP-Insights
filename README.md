![churn 1.png](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1024/1*TgciopaOk-C8fwtPmmet3w.png)

In today's competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is crucial. Customer churn, where users leave for another provider, can significantly impact a company's bottom line. This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave based on usage patterns, behavior, and other factors. By understanding these patterns, companies can take proactive measures to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn.

This repository contains all the necessary components for analyzing customer churn, from the dataset to the code for predictions. It also offers insights into key factors driving customer attrition, suggests strategies for improving retention, and explores the role of natural language processing (NLP) in understanding customer sentiments.

## Problem Statement

In the dynamic landscape of the telecommunications industry, customers can choose from a wide range of service providers. Customer satisfaction is vital, as users often base their perceptions of a company on singular interactions. The significance of understanding and mitigating customer churn is highlighted by the direct impact of churn rate on revenue. 

Given the high costs associated with acquiring new customers, in-depth churn analysis is essential. Insights derived from this analysis empower companies to formulate strategic approaches, target specific segments, and enhance service quality. By building predictive models and integrating NLP insights to analyze customer feedback, we can drive sustainable growth and strengthen customer loyalty.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Curated a comprehensive dataset comprising customer demographics, service usage details, contract specifics, and billing preferences.
   - Employed rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure data integrity and consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted in-depth EDA to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the dataset.
   - Visualized key metrics such as customer segmentation by contract type and churn propensity across different customer segments using tools like Power BI for interactive visualizations.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Insights:**
   - Analyzed customer feedback and interactions to extract sentiments and identify common pain points using NLP techniques.
   - Employed text preprocessing methods, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, to prepare text data for analysis.
   - Utilized sentiment analysis to correlate customer sentiments with churn rates, gaining deeper insights into factors influencing attrition.

4. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
   - Evaluated model performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score to select the optimal model for churn prediction.
